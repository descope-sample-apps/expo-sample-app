This sample app is an open-source project, built with React Native and Expo. It demonstrates the integration of Descope Flows in a mobile application. This app also showcases user login via OAuth 2.0 standard, managing user sessions, and navigating between different screens based on the authentication state.

> **Note:** If you simply want Social Login, without any other flows, you can simply attach a `Sign Up or In / OAuth` action between the `Start` and `End` parts of your flow, and define which Provider you wish to you (e.g. Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.)
